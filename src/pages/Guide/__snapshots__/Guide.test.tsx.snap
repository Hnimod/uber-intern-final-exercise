        On-demand transportation technology is our core service, and the app that connects drivers-partners and riders is what makes it all possible. Here's how it works, step by step:
      </p>
      <section
        className="steps"
      >
        <h3>
          Step 1: A rider opens the app
        </h3>
        <p>
          The rider enters their destination into the Where to? box on the top of the screen, taps each ride option to see the wait time, car sizes, and price; then confirms their pickup location and taps Request.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Step 2: The rider is matched with a driver
        </h3>
        <p>
          A nearby driver sees and chooses to accept the rider's trip request. the rider is automatically notified when the driver's vehicle is about a minute away
        </p>
        <h3>
          Step 3: The rider picks up the rider
        </h3>
        <p>
          The driver and the rider verify each other's names and the destination. Then the driver starts the ride.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Step 4: The driver takes the rider to the destination
        </h3>
        <p>
          The app gives the driver the option to access turn-by-turn directions. so the driver can focus on getting there and the rider can focus on enjoying a comfortable ride
        </p>
        <h3>
          Step 5: The driver and rider leave ratings and reviews
        </h3>
        <p>
          At the end of each trip, drivers and riders can rate each other from 1 to 5 stars. Riders can also give the driver compliments. In cities where tipping is available, they can also add a little extra to show their gratitude.
